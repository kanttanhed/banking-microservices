# ðŸš€ Banking Microservices System

Welcome to the **Banking Microservices System**, where finance meets cutting-edge technology in a geeky dance of microservices magic! This project is a showcase of modern banking operations managed through a robust microservices architecture. Weâ€™ve built two key services:

1. **Account Opening Service** â€“ Where new bank accounts come to life! ðŸŒŸ
2. **Credit Card Request Service** â€“ Your gateway to the world of credit! ðŸ’³

## ðŸŒŸ Whatâ€™s Under the Hood?

This project utilizes a host of modern technologies to ensure a smooth, scalable, and geeky experience:

- **Spring Boot** with **Java 17** for high-performance service development.
- **API Gateway** for smart routing and load balancing.
- **Docker Compose** to orchestrate our containerized services.
- **Kafka** for seamless asynchronous communication.
- **Redis** for super-fast caching.
- **PostgreSQL** to handle our data with reliability.
- **SLF4J** for logging every detail.
- **Lombok** to keep our code elegant and concise.
- **JUnit5** for ensuring our code is rock-solid.
- **Swagger** for documenting and testing APIs like a boss!

## ðŸ“Š Architecture Overview

Dive into the architecture that powers our geeky banking system. With microservices communicating seamlessly and data managed efficiently, the system is a testament to modern engineering practices.
